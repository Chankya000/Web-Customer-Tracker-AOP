# Web-Customer-Tracker-AOP
implementation of Aspect Oriented Programming in a MVC architecture 
AOP is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. 
It does this by adding additional behavior to existing code without modifying the code itself.
Instead, we can declare the new code and the new behaviors separately.
Spring's AOP framework helps us implement these cross-cutting concerns.
